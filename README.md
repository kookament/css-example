css-example
===========

A simple interactive view to show how different CSS selectors behave.

Due to security protections, you can't just open up the file in your browser. Instead start a local webserver, e.g., Node's `http-server`:

```sh
npm install -g http-server
http-server .
```

Then visit the URL it tells you to (usually port 8080: [http://localhost:8080/css-example.html](http://localhost:8080/css-example.html)).
